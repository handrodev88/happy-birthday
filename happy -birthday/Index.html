        Paulina, whenever you feel down, remember these two things because they apply deeply to who you are.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first is from a homily by St. Cosmas, who said:
        "Brethren, I am a servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, who was crucified. Not that I am worthy to be a servant of Christ, but Christ, in His compassion, condescended to have me. Not only am I unworthy to teach you, but I am not even worthy to kiss your feet. For each of you is worth more than the entire world."

        <br>
        <br>
        
        The second is written in Psalms, where it says:
        "Precious are the thoughts You have for me, O God; they outnumber the sands of the sea."
        <br>
        <br>
        You have a priceless worth to God and to those around youâ€”but first and foremost, to God
